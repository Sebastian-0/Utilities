# Utilities
This repository contains some general-purpose utilites that I use in my projects. The following are some of the utilities included:
 * A logger class called Debugger which is handy to report errors
 * An object pool that can be used to reuse object instances
 * A zip-file extractor that makes it easy to extract the contents of a zip-file
